idx=471 RAW:
<Reasoning>A pet cage is not a suitable barrier between children and breakable electronic devices; it's more likely to be used to house pets and would be impractical for this purpose. A more practical solution would be covering the devices with a barrier to prevent accidental damage or tampering, such as a physical barrier or furniture, not just draping a blanket which is unlikely to be effective, it could still be torn or accidentally touched. A better option is to arrange items around it in such a way so as to prevent accidental access, or secure it in such a way that physical damage would be very difficult to achieve, but arranging a simple cage around it is not that practical, so, you'd be better off selecting the second choice, however, this option is not good enough. Therefore an additional method would be to physically block or secure access, however the options presented do not have a third. In this scenario the best out of the bad options is, even though it is not ideal, a physical barrier. Considering the choices given  'arrange a simple pet cage around it' is more physically safer for blocking access than 'drape a blanket over the devices', which is why I have chosen this option over the blanket.

<Reasoning>Since both answers are identical, this isn't a good question.

It seems like both options 1 and 2 contain the same steps. It appears that one of the choices is a duplicate.
