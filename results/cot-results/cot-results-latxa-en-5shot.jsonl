{"idx": 1815, "label": 0, "reasoning": "Boiled eggs are typically eaten whole, including both the white and the yolk, providing essential nutrients and protein. Cutting off the white around the yolk would result in wasting some of the edible parts of the egg.", "prediction": "1"}
{"idx": 1816, "label": 1, "reasoning": "Cutting the screen one to two inches smaller than the edge of the window ensures that the screen fits snugly inside the frame and doesn't flap in the wind, whereas cutting it with extra clearance might cause it to rattle or move around.", "prediction": "1"}
{"idx": 1817, "label": 0, "reasoning": "The first option describes a traditional Greek cucumber salad recipe where the ingredients are mixed together without pureeing them, allowing each component to maintain its texture and flavor.

{"idx": 1818, "label": 1, "reasoning": "The second method is less likely to damage the pages or the binding of the book because it doesn't involve cutting the book with scissors, which could potentially tear the pages or the cover.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1819, "label": 1, "reasoning": "A stiff-bristled brush is better suited for removing debris from the delicate speaker and microphone meshes because it can more effectively reach into the small spaces and remove any stubborn particles without damaging the mesh.", "prediction": "1"}
{"idx": 1820, "label": 1, "reasoning": "The process of using ice to set the dent involves applying cold temperatures to contract the carpet fibers, making them shrink back into place. Using an ice cube is more practical and controlled than letting ice cream melt, which would create a mess.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1821, "label": 0, "reasoning": "Tipping a hat typically involves moving it forward slightly to acknowledge someone or show respect, rather than moving it upwards which would be more like removing the hat.", "prediction": "1"}
{"idx": 1822, "label": 0, "reasoning": "Matches are designed to be ignited by rubbing the match head against the matchbox, which creates friction and generates heat until the match ignites. The second option is incorrect because asphalt is not a flammable material that would ignite a match.", "prediction": "1"}
{"idx": 1823, "label": 1, "reasoning": "Olive pits are toxic and should not be consumed, so they would not be suitable for making a sauce to eat. Sugar is commonly used as a sweetener in sauces, making it a more likely choice for this recipe.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1824, "label": 0, "reasoning": "Magazines are generally more susceptible to damage from liquids that are poured or dripped onto them, such as from a jar, rather than being wiped across with a mop which tends to be more forceful and less controlled.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1825, "label": 0, "reasoning": "Going to a professional locksmith or an auto parts store like Walmart's auto center allows for accurate duplication of keys using specialized equipment, whereas cutting out a piece of metal by hand would likely result in an incorrect or unusable key.", "prediction": "1"}

{"idx": 1830, "label": 1, "reasoning": "Holding dumbbells allows for more resistance and weight-bearing exercise, which can help strengthen the muscles in the lower body, whereas holding phones would provide minimal resistance and may not be as effective for building strength.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1831, "label": 0, "reasoning": "Muffin tins are designed to hold small portions of food, making them suitable for storing condiments like mustard, ketchup, mayo, BBQ sauce, and dips.

{"idx": 1833, "label": 1, "reasoning": "Adding chocolate and caramel to hot milk and cream requires tempering the chocolate so it melts evenly and doesn't seize up. Adding it to a cooled mixture would cause the chocolate to seize, resulting in an unpleasant texture. Bringing the mixture to a simmer first helps to melt the chocolate smoothly.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1834, "label": 0, "reasoning": "The blender is more effective at breaking down the tough peel and pulpy interior of an orange into a smooth pulp, whereas a hand mixer might struggle to break down the peel and may leave larger pieces intact.", "prediction": "1"}
{"idx": 1835, "label": 1, "reasoning": "The difference between the two options is the position of the marshmallow relative to the fire. Holding the marshmallow directly in the flames can cause it to burn too quickly and unevenly, while holding it over the fire allows for even heating and toasting.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1836, "label": 0, "reasoning": "A power washer can generate high-pressure water jets that can effectively remove stubborn grime and dirt from surfaces, but using one on an aging cruise liner requires caution due to its size and potential damage to the surface, whereas a small item like a white t-shirt would be easier to clean with a power washer without causing harm.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1837, "label": 0, "reasoning": "Tennis balls are specifically designed for playing tennis, so they would likely be sold at a store that specializes in tennis equipment, which is typically a sports store.", "prediction": "1"}
