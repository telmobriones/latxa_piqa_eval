To spread peace, one needs to promote positive interactions and harmony among individuals. Being nice to everyone all the time fosters a supportive environment where people feel valued and respected, leading to increased trust and understanding. This can help resolve conflicts peacefully and create a more harmonious community. On the other hand, being mean to everyone all the time would likely lead to resentment, conflict, and a breakdown in relationships.
