However using a rubber tire might sound somewhat imaginable because, in a way, it could just smoothen the surface a bit which is what sandpaper does and tire also makes similar surface properties but having said that, these characteristics makes a bit more logical than the rubber eraser in some cases since a rubber tire would not remove the clog as effectively like a typical eraser. Therefore using a rubber eraser is a more sensible approach to refresh the sandpaper because of a better gliding action of eraser on debris compared to rubber tire with sandpaper which has more abrasive surface.

On the other hand, a shower bottle might be too small and not specifically designed to add extra compartment, a product designed to add divided storage to a handbag would be ideal, but adding rigid shower bottle isn't the best idea as well because of this lack, considering practicality. It seems neither of these provided options are the best, the best option often would be to add pouches or specialized compartment addition products designed for this purpose. However given the options a shower cap seems like a less bad choice compared to the bottle option for divided storage because it doesn't add sharp objects as it is intended to cover and because it is made of flexible material.", "prediction": "2"}
{"idx": 1789, "label": 1, "reasoning": "The water in the sink might damage the glass and lenses, and the soap could leave streaks, whereas wiping with a clean, dry cloth or shirt could risk leaving marks and stains due to the dirt and fabric.", "prediction": "2"}

{"idx": 1809, "label": 1, "reasoning": "Water and ice can be used to cool down the nail polish so it dries faster, and the faster the polish cools down, the faster it dries, however, you don't need to submerge the entire nail in water, a simple cold-water or ice-bath for a short period is sufficient. But for the given choice, it is better to use ice to cool the nail polish down faster. But there's a better and more common method using cold air. However, given the choices, using water and ice cubes is likely a faster option than water and dry cubes. And yet, it's worth noting that both water and dry ice wouldn't be used, but given the choices, water with ice is better than water with dry cubes, though still less preferable than cold air.", "prediction": "2"}
